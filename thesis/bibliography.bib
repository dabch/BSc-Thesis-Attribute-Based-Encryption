	abstract = {As more sensitive data is shared and stored by third-party sites on the Internet, there will be a need to encrypt data stored at these sites. One drawback of encrypting data, is that it can be selectively shared only at a coarse-grained level (i.e., giving another party your private key). We develop a new cryptosystem for ﬁne-grained sharing of encrypted data that we call Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (KP-ABE). In our cryptosystem, ciphertexts are labeled with sets of attributes and private keys are associated with access structures that control which ciphertexts a user is able to decrypt. We demonstrate the applicability of our construction to sharing of audit-log information and broadcast encryption. Our construction supports delegation of private keys which subsumes Hierarchical Identity-Based Encryption (HIBE).},

Currently, the only method for enforcing such policies is to employ a trusted server to store the data and mediate access control. However, if any server storing the data is compromised, then the conﬁdentiality of the data will be compromised. In this paper we present a system for realizing complex access control on encrypted data that we call Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption. By using our techniques encrypted data can be kept conﬁdential even if the storage server is untrusted; moreover, our methods are secure against collusion attacks. Previous AttributeBased Encryption systems used attributes to describe the encrypted data and built policies into user’s keys; while in our system attributes are used to describe a user’s credentials, and a party encrypting data determines a policy for who can decrypt. Thus, our methods are conceptually closer to traditional access control methods such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). In addition, we provide an implementation of our system and give performance measurements.},

	abstract = {Several pairing-based cryptographic protocols are recently proposed with a wide variety of new novel applications including the ones in emerging technologies like cloud computing, internet of things (IoT), e-health systems and wearable technologies. There have been however a wide range of incorrect use of these primitives. The paper of Galbraith, Paterson, and Smart (2006) pointed out most of the issues related to the incorrect use of pairing-based cryptography. However, we noticed that some recently proposed applications still do not use these primitives correctly. This leads to unrealizable, insecure or too ineﬃcient designs of pairing-based protocols. We observed that one reason is not being aware of the recent advancements on solving the discrete logarithm problems in some groups. The main purpose of this article is to give an understandable, informative, and the most up-to-date criteria for the correct use of pairing-based cryptography. We thereby deliberately avoid most of the technical details and rather give special emphasis on the importance of the correct use of bilinear maps by realizing secure cryptographic protocols. We list a collection of some recent papers having wrong security assumptions or realizability/eﬃciency issues. Finally, we give a compact and an up-to-date recipe of the correct use of pairings.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging network paradigm, which realizes the interconnections among the ubiquitous things and is the foundation of smart society. Since IoT are always related to user’s daily life or work, the privacy and security are of great importance. The pervasive, complex and heterogeneous properties of IoT make its security issues very challenging. In addition, the large number of resources-constraint nodes makes a rigid lightweight requirement for IoT security mechanisms. Presently, the attribute-based encryption (ABE) is a popular solution to achieve secure data transmission, storage and sharing in the distributed environment such as IoT. However, the existing ABE schemes are based on expensive bilinear pairing, which make them not suitable for the resources-constraint IoT applications. In this paper, a lightweight no-pairing ABE scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is proposed to address the security and privacy issues in IoT. The security of the proposed scheme is based on the ECDDH assumption instead of bilinear Diffie–Hellman assumption, and is proved in the attribute based selective-set model. By uniformly determining the criteria and defining the metrics for measuring the communication overhead and computational overhead, the comparison analyses with the existing ABE schemes are made in detail. The results show that the proposed scheme has improved execution efficiency and low communication costs. In addition, the limitations and the improving directions of it are also discussed in detail.},

A Fuzzy IBE scheme can be applied to enable encryption using biometric inputs as identities; the error-tolerance property of a Fuzzy IBE scheme is precisely what allows for the use of biometric identities, which inherently will have some noise each time they are sampled. Additionally, we show that Fuzzy-IBE can be used for a type of application that we term “attribute-based encryption”.},

One significant obstacle for the widespread deployment of pairing-based cryptography are its tremendous hardware and software requirements.

A Fuzzy IBE scheme allows for a private key for an identity, ω, to decrypt a ciphertext encrypted with an identity, ω , if and only if the identities ω and ω are close to each other as measured by the “set overlap” distance metric. A Fuzzy IBE scheme can be applied to enable encryption using biometric inputs as identities; the error-tolerance property of a Fuzzy IBE scheme is precisely what allows for the use of biometric identities, which inherently will have some noise each time they are sampled. Additionally, we show that Fuzzy-IBE can be used for a type of application that we term “attribute-based encryption”.},

Among the numerous proposed security schemes, attribute-based encryption (ABE) is considered as one of the most promising security and privacy preserving scheme in distributed environment (or cloud environment). Many variants of the ABE exist, but most of them employ the expensive bilinear pairing operations. In this article, we have proposed a lightweight elliptic-curve-cryptography-based key-policy ABE without bilinear pairing and having a feature of key refresh/update mechanism. Also, the key distribution is done by the authority, which incorporates direct attribute/user revocation. The scheme is secured under elliptic curve decisional Difﬁe–Hellman assumption. The performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme is efﬁcient as compared to the existing ABE schemes.},

	abstract = {As a one-to-many public key encryption system, attribute-based encryption (ABE) enables scalable access control over encrypted data in cloud storage services. However, efficient user revocation has been a very challenging problem in ABE. To address this issue, Boldyreva, Goyal and Kumar [5] introduced a revocation method by combining the binary tree data structure with fuzzy identity-based encryption, in which a key generation center (KGC) periodically broadcasts key update information to all data users over a public channel. The Boldyreva-Goyal-Kumar approach reduces the size of key updates from linear to logarithm in the number of users, and it has been widely used in subsequent revocable ABE systems; however, it requires each data user to keep a private key of logarithmic size and all non-revoked data users to periodically update decryption keys for each new time period. To further optimize user revocation in ABE, in this paper, we propose a notion called server-aided revocable ABE (SR-ABE), in which almost all workloads of data users incurred by user revocation are delegated to an untrusted server and each data user only needs to store a key of constant size. We then define a security model for SR-ABE, and present a concrete SR-ABE scheme secure under this model. Interestingly, due to the key embedding gadget employed in the construction of SR-ABE, our SR-ABE scheme does not require any secure channels for key transmission, and also enjoys an additional property in the decryption phase, where a data user only needs to perform one exponentiation computation to decrypt a ciphertext.},

	abstract = {Linear Secret Sharing Scheme (LSSS) matrices are commonly used for implementing monotone access structures in highly expressive Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) schemes. However, LSSS matrices are much less intuitive to use when compared with other approaches such as boolean formulas or access trees. To bridge the gap between the usability of an access structure representation method and the implementation technique required in a concrete CP-ABE construction, Lewko and Waters proposed an algorithm which can convert any monotone boolean formulas to LSSS matrices. This algorithm is very useful in practice as a ciphertext policy can now be intuitively expressed using a monotone boolean formula, which has good usability, and the corresponding LSSS for an actual CP-ABE construction can then be generated accordingly using this algorithm. However, in this algorithm, the non-leaf nodes of a monotone boolean formula, when viewed as an access tree, can only be AND or OR gates. For general monotone access structures, for example, in a (t, n)-threshold access tree, the threshold gates of the tree have to be converted to AND and OR gates before we can apply the algorithm on this access tree. This results in generating a large LSSS matrix, and entailing a large CPABE ciphertext. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a new algorithm which, in addition to AND and OR gates, can directly support threshold gates, and obtain much smaller LSSS matrices (or the same in the worst case when only AND and OR gates exist). This will particularly be useful for reducing the size of all ciphertexts with policies in the typical (t, n)-threshold type. Furthermore, as AND and OR gates are the special cases of the general (t, n)-threshold gates, not only an optimization, but also is this new algorithm a generalization of the Lewko-Waters algorithm.},

This is desirable for low-bitrate Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSANs) which often are the heart of (I)IoT systems. In SEA-BREW, sensors, actuators, and users can exchange encrypted data via a cloud server, or directly via wireless if they belong to the same WSAN. We formally prove that our scheme is secure also in case of an untrusted cloud server that colludes with a set of users, under the generic bilinear group model. We show by simulations that our scheme requires a constant computational overhead on the cloud server with respect to the complexity of the access control policies.

In contrast to state-of-the-art ABE schemes, ours is capable of securely performing key revocations with a single short broadcast message, instead of a number of unicast messages that is linear with the number of nodes. This is desirable for low-bitrate Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSANs) which often are the heart of (I)IoT systems. In SEA-BREW, sensors, actuators, and users can exchange encrypted data via a cloud server, or directly via wireless if they belong to the same WSAN. We formally prove that our scheme is secure also in case of an untrusted cloud server that colludes with a set of users, under the generic bilinear group model. We show by simulations that our scheme requires a constant computational overhead on the cloud server with respect to the complexity of the access control policies. This is in contrast to state-of-the-art solutions, which require instead a linear computational overhead.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is enabling a new generation of innovative services based on the seamless integration of smart objects into information systems. Such IoT devices generate an uninterrupted ﬂow of information that can be transmitted through an untrusted network and stored on an untrusted infrastructure. The latter raises new security and privacy challenges that require novel cryptographic methods. Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) is a new type of public-key encryption that ensures a ﬁne-grained access control mechanism on encrypted data based on ﬂexible access policies. The feasibility of ABE adoption in fully-ﬂedged computing systems, i.e. smartphones or embedded systems, has been demonstrated in recent works. In this paper we assess the feasibility of the adoption of ABE in typical IoT constrained devices, characterized by limited capabilities in terms of computing, storage and power. Speciﬁcally, an implementation of three ABE schemes for ESP32, a low-cost popular platform to deploy IoT devices, is developed and evaluated in terms of encryption/decryption time and energy consumption. The performance evaluation shows that the adoption of ABE on constrained devices is feasible, although it has a cost that increases with the number of attributes. The analysis in particular highlights how ABE has a signiﬁcant impact in the lifetime of battery-powered devices, which is impaired signiﬁcantly when a high number of attributes is adopted.},

	abstract = {We provide a design and implementation of self-protecting electronic medical records (EMRs) using attribute-based encryption. Our system allows healthcare organizations to export EMRs to storage locations outside of their trust boundary, including mobile devices, Regional Health Information Organizations (RHIOs), and cloud systems such as Google Health. In contrast to some previous approaches to this problem, our solution is designed to maintain EMR availability even when providers are oﬄine, i.e., where network connectivity is not available (for example, during a natural disaster). To balance the needs of emergency care and patient privacy, our system is designed to provide for ﬁne-grained encryption and is able to protect individual items within an EMR, where each encrypted item may have its own access control policy. To validate our architecture, we implemented a prototype system using a new dual-policy attribute-based encryption library that we developed. Our implementation, which includes an iPhone app for storing and managing EMRs oﬄine, allows for ﬂexible and automatic policy generation. An evaluation of our design shows that our ABE library performs well, has acceptable storage requirements, and is practical and usable on modern smartphones.},

In particular, we implemented AndrABEn, an ABE library for Android operating system. Our library is written in the C language and implements two main ABE schemes: Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption, and Key- Policy Attribute-Based Encryption. We also run a thorough set of experimental evaluation for AndrABEn, and compare it with the current state-of-the-art (considering the same experimental setting). The results confirm the possibility to effectively use ABE on smartphone devices, requiring an acceptable amount of resources in terms of computations and energy consumption. Since the current state-of-the-art claims the non feasibility of ABE on mobile devices, we believe that our study (together with the AndrABEn library that we made available online) is a key result that will pave the way for researchers and developers to design and implement novel protocols and applications for mobile devices.},

We exploit state-of-the-art techniques and propose new optimizations to speed up the computation in the tower field and curve arithmetic. In particular, we extend the concept of lazy reduction to inversion in extension fields, analyze an efficient alternative for the sparse multiplication used inside the Miller’s algorithm and reduce further the cost of point/line evaluation formulas in affine and projective homogeneous coordinates. In addition, we study the efficiency of using M-type sextic twists in the pairing computation and carry out a detailed comparison between affine and projective coordinate systems. Our implementations on various mass-market smartphones and tablets significantly improve the state-of-the-art of pairing computation on ARM-powered devices, outperforming by at least a factor of 3.7 the best previous results in the literature.},

For the last decade, elliptic curve cryptography has gained increasing interest in industry and in the academic community. This is especially due to the high level of security it provides with relatively small keys and to its ability to create very efficient and multifunctional cryptographic schemes by means of bilinear pairings. Pairings require pairing-friendly elliptic curves and among the possible choices, Barreto–Naehrig (BN) curves arguably constitute one of the most versatile families. In this paper, we further expand the potential of the BN curve family. We describe BN curves that are not only computationally very simple to generate, but also specially suitable for efficient implementation on a very broad range of scenarios. We also present implementation results of the optimal ate pairing using such a curve defined over a 254-bit prime field.},

More general methods produce curves over \$\{{\textbackslash}mathbb F\}\_\{p\}\$where the bit length of p is often twice as large as that of the order r of the subgroup with embedding degree k; the best published results achieve ρ ≡ log(p)/log(r) {\textasciitilde} 5/4. In this paper we make the first step towards surpassing these limitations by describing a method to construct elliptic curves of prime order and embedding degree k = 12. The new curves lead to very efficient implementation: non-pairing operations need no more than \$\{{\textbackslash}mathbb F\}\_\{p{\textasciicircum}4\}\$arithmetic, and pairing values can be compressed to one third of their length in a way compatible with point reduction techniques. We also discuss the role of large CM discriminants D to minimize ρ; in particular, for embedding degree k = 2q where q is prime we show that the ability to handle log(D)/log(r) {\textasciitilde} (q–3)/(q–1) enables building curves with ρ {\textasciitilde} q/(q–1).},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is emerging with the pace of technology evolution, connecting people and things through the Internet. IoT devices enable large-scale data collection and sharing for a wide range of applications. However, it is challenging to securely manage interconnected IoT devices because the collected data could contain sensitive personal information. The authors believe that attribute-based encryption (ABE) could be an effective cryptographic tool for secure management of IoT devices. However, little research has addressed ABE's actual feasibility in the IoT thus far. This article investigates such feasibility considering well-known IoT platforms--specifically, Intel Galileo Gen 2, Intel Edison, Raspberry Pi 1 Model B, and Raspberry Pi Zero. A thorough evaluation confirms that adopting ABE in the IoT is indeed feasible.},
