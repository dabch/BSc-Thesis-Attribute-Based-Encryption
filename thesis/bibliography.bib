	abstract = {As more sensitive data is shared and stored by third-party sites on the Internet, there will be a need to encrypt data stored at these sites. One drawback of encrypting data, is that it can be selectively shared only at a coarse-grained level (i.e., giving another party your private key). We develop a new cryptosystem for ﬁne-grained sharing of encrypted data that we call Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption ({KP}-{ABE}). In our cryptosystem, ciphertexts are labeled with sets of attributes and private keys are associated with access structures that control which ciphertexts a user is able to decrypt. We demonstrate the applicability of our construction to sharing of audit-log information and broadcast encryption. Our construction supports delegation of private keys which subsumes Hierarchical Identity-Based Encryption ({HIBE}).},

	abstract = {In several distributed systems a user should only be able to access data if a user posses a certain set of credentials or attributes. Currently, the only method for enforcing such policies is to employ a trusted server to store the data and mediate access control. However, if any server storing the data is compromised, then the conﬁdentiality of the data will be compromised. In this paper we present a system for realizing complex access control on encrypted data that we call Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption. By using our techniques encrypted data can be kept conﬁdential even if the storage server is untrusted; moreover, our methods are secure against collusion attacks. Previous {AttributeBased} Encryption systems used attributes to describe the encrypted data and built policies into user’s keys; while in our system attributes are used to describe a user’s credentials, and a party encrypting data determines a policy for who can decrypt. Thus, our methods are conceptually closer to traditional access control methods such as Role-Based Access Control ({RBAC}). In addition, we provide an implementation of our system and give performance measurements.},

	abstract = {Several pairing-based cryptographic protocols are recently proposed with a wide variety of new novel applications including the ones in emerging technologies like cloud computing, internet of things ({IoT}), e-health systems and wearable technologies. There have been however a wide range of incorrect use of these primitives. The paper of Galbraith, Paterson, and Smart (2006) pointed out most of the issues related to the incorrect use of pairing-based cryptography. However, we noticed that some recently proposed applications still do not use these primitives correctly. This leads to unrealizable, insecure or too ineﬃcient designs of pairing-based protocols. We observed that one reason is not being aware of the recent advancements on solving the discrete logarithm problems in some groups. The main purpose of this article is to give an understandable, informative, and the most up-to-date criteria for the correct use of pairing-based cryptography. We thereby deliberately avoid most of the technical details and rather give special emphasis on the importance of the correct use of bilinear maps by realizing secure cryptographic protocols. We list a collection of some recent papers having wrong security assumptions or realizability/eﬃciency issues. Finally, we give a compact and an up-to-date recipe of the correct use of pairings.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things ({IoT}) is an emerging network paradigm, which realizes the interconnections among the ubiquitous things and is the foundation of smart society. Since {IoT} are always related to user’s daily life or work, the privacy and security are of great importance. The pervasive, complex and heterogeneous properties of {IoT} make its security issues very challenging. In addition, the large number of resources-constraint nodes makes a rigid lightweight requirement for {IoT} security mechanisms. Presently, the attribute-based encryption ({ABE}) is a popular solution to achieve secure data transmission, storage and sharing in the distributed environment such as {IoT}. However, the existing {ABE} schemes are based on expensive bilinear pairing, which make them not suitable for the resources-constraint {IoT} applications. In this paper, a lightweight no-pairing {ABE} scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography ({ECC}) is proposed to address the security and privacy issues in {IoT}. The security of the proposed scheme is based on the {ECDDH} assumption instead of bilinear Diffie–Hellman assumption, and is proved in the attribute based selective-set model. By uniformly determining the criteria and defining the metrics for measuring the communication overhead and computational overhead, the comparison analyses with the existing {ABE} schemes are made in detail. The results show that the proposed scheme has improved execution efficiency and low communication costs. In addition, the limitations and the improving directions of it are also discussed in detail.},

A Fuzzy {IBE} scheme can be applied to enable encryption using biometric inputs as identities; the error-tolerance property of a Fuzzy {IBE} scheme is precisely what allows for the use of biometric identities, which inherently will have some noise each time they are sampled. Additionally, we show that Fuzzy-{IBE} can be used for a type of application that we term “attribute-based encryption”.},

This is a game-changer for developers who no longer need to struggle with assembly language programming, but rather can bring to bear all of the tools of modern software engineering, including high level language compilers. At the same time curve based cryptography has matured to the extent that eﬃcient curves and algorithms are now well known. However the dynamics of academic research are such that execution speed, mandating continued use of assembly language, trumps all other considerations.

A Fuzzy {IBE} scheme can be applied to enable encryption using biometric inputs as identities; the error-tolerance property of a Fuzzy {IBE} scheme is precisely what allows for the use of biometric identities, which inherently will have some noise each time they are sampled. Additionally, we show that Fuzzy-{IBE} can be used for a type of application that we term “attribute-based encryption”.},

Among the numerous proposed security schemes, attribute-based encryption ({ABE}) is considered as one of the most promising security and privacy preserving scheme in distributed environment (or cloud environment). Many variants of the {ABE} exist, but most of them employ the expensive bilinear pairing operations. In this article, we have proposed a lightweight elliptic-curve-cryptography-based key-policy {ABE} without bilinear pairing and having a feature of key refresh/update mechanism. Also, the key distribution is done by the authority, which incorporates direct attribute/user revocation. The scheme is secured under elliptic curve decisional Difﬁe–Hellman assumption. The performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme is efﬁcient as compared to the existing {ABE} schemes.},

	abstract = {As a one-to-many public key encryption system, attribute-based encryption ({ABE}) enables scalable access control over encrypted data in cloud storage services. However, efficient user revocation has been a very challenging problem in {ABE}. To address this issue, Boldyreva, Goyal and Kumar [5] introduced a revocation method by combining the binary tree data structure with fuzzy identity-based encryption, in which a key generation center ({KGC}) periodically broadcasts key update information to all data users over a public channel. The Boldyreva-Goyal-Kumar approach reduces the size of key updates from linear to logarithm in the number of users, and it has been widely used in subsequent revocable {ABE} systems; however, it requires each data user to keep a private key of logarithmic size and all non-revoked data users to periodically update decryption keys for each new time period. To further optimize user revocation in {ABE}, in this paper, we propose a notion called server-aided revocable {ABE} ({SR}-{ABE}), in which almost all workloads of data users incurred by user revocation are delegated to an untrusted server and each data user only needs to store a key of constant size. We then define a security model for {SR}-{ABE}, and present a concrete {SR}-{ABE} scheme secure under this model. Interestingly, due to the key embedding gadget employed in the construction of {SR}-{ABE}, our {SR}-{ABE} scheme does not require any secure channels for key transmission, and also enjoys an additional property in the decryption phase, where a data user only needs to perform one exponentiation computation to decrypt a ciphertext.},

	title = {Efﬁcient Generation of Linear Secret Sharing Scheme Matrices from Threshold Access Trees},
	abstract = {Linear Secret Sharing Scheme ({LSSS}) matrices are commonly used for implementing monotone access structures in highly expressive Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption ({CP}-{ABE}) schemes. However, {LSSS} matrices are much less intuitive to use when compared with other approaches such as boolean formulas or access trees. To bridge the gap between the usability of an access structure representation method and the implementation technique required in a concrete {CP}-{ABE} construction, Lewko and Waters proposed an algorithm which can convert any monotone boolean formulas to {LSSS} matrices. This algorithm is very useful in practice as a ciphertext policy can now be intuitively expressed using a monotone boolean formula, which has good usability, and the corresponding {LSSS} for an actual {CP}-{ABE} construction can then be generated accordingly using this algorithm. However, in this algorithm, the non-leaf nodes of a monotone boolean formula, when viewed as an access tree, can only be {AND} or {OR} gates. For general monotone access structures, for example, in a (t, n)-threshold access tree, the threshold gates of the tree have to be converted to {AND} and {OR} gates before we can apply the algorithm on this access tree. This results in generating a large {LSSS} matrix, and entailing a large {CPABE} ciphertext. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a new algorithm which, in addition to {AND} and {OR} gates, can directly support threshold gates, and obtain much smaller {LSSS} matrices (or the same in the worst case when only {AND} and {OR} gates exist). This will particularly be useful for reducing the size of all ciphertexts with policies in the typical (t, n)-threshold type. Furthermore, as {AND} and {OR} gates are the special cases of the general (t, n)-threshold gates, not only an optimization, but also is this new algorithm a generalization of the Lewko-Waters algorithm.},

In this paper we propose a novel {ABE} scheme called {SEA}-{BREW} (Scalable and Eﬃcient Abe with Broadcast {REvocation} for Wireless networks), which is suited for Internet of Things ({IoT}) and Industrial {IoT} ({IIoT}) applications. In contrast to state-of-the-art {ABE} schemes, ours is capable of securely performing key revocations with a single short broadcast message, instead of a number of unicast messages that is linear with the number of nodes. This is desirable for low-bitrate Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks ({WSANs}) which often are the heart of (I){IoT} systems. In {SEA}-{BREW}, sensors, actuators, and users can exchange encrypted data via a cloud server, or directly via wireless if they belong to the same {WSAN}. We formally prove that our scheme is secure also in case of an untrusted cloud server that colludes with a set of users, under the generic bilinear group model. We show by simulations that our scheme requires a constant computational overhead on the cloud server with respect to the complexity of the access control policies. This is in contrast to state-of-the-art solutions, which require instead a linear computational overhead.},

	abstract = {Attribute-Based Encryption ({ABE}) is an emerging cryptographic technique that allows one to embed a fine-grained access control mechanism into encrypted data. In this paper we propose a novel {ABE} scheme called {SEA}-{BREW} (Scalable and Efficient Abe with Broadcast {REvocation} for Wireless networks), which is suited for Internet of Things ({IoT}) and Industrial {IoT} ({IIoT}) applications. In contrast to state-of-the-art {ABE} schemes, ours is capable of securely performing key revocations with a single short broadcast message, instead of a number of unicast messages that is linear with the number of nodes. This is desirable for low-bitrate Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks ({WSANs}) which often are the heart of (I){IoT} systems. In {SEA}-{BREW}, sensors, actuators, and users can exchange encrypted data via a cloud server, or directly via wireless if they belong to the same {WSAN}. We formally prove that our scheme is secure also in case of an untrusted cloud server that colludes with a set of users, under the generic bilinear group model. We show by simulations that our scheme requires a constant computational overhead on the cloud server with respect to the complexity of the access control policies. This is in contrast to state-of-the-art solutions, which require instead a linear computational overhead.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things ({IoT}) is enabling a new generation of innovative services based on the seamless integration of smart objects into information systems. Such {IoT} devices generate an uninterrupted ﬂow of information that can be transmitted through an untrusted network and stored on an untrusted infrastructure. The latter raises new security and privacy challenges that require novel cryptographic methods. Attribute-Based Encryption ({ABE}) is a new type of public-key encryption that ensures a ﬁne-grained access control mechanism on encrypted data based on ﬂexible access policies. The feasibility of {ABE} adoption in fully-ﬂedged computing systems, i.e. smartphones or embedded systems, has been demonstrated in recent works. In this paper we assess the feasibility of the adoption of {ABE} in typical {IoT} constrained devices, characterized by limited capabilities in terms of computing, storage and power. Speciﬁcally, an implementation of three {ABE} schemes for {ESP}32, a low-cost popular platform to deploy {IoT} devices, is developed and evaluated in terms of encryption/decryption time and energy consumption. The performance evaluation shows that the adoption of {ABE} on constrained devices is feasible, although it has a cost that increases with the number of attributes. The analysis in particular highlights how {ABE} has a signiﬁcant impact in the lifetime of battery-powered devices, which is impaired signiﬁcantly when a high number of attributes is adopted.},
