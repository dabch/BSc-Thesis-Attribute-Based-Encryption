	abstract = {As more sensitive data is shared and stored by third-party sites on the Internet, there will be a need to encrypt data stored at these sites. One drawback of encrypting data, is that it can be selectively shared only at a coarse-grained level (i.e., giving another party your private key). We develop a new cryptosystem for ﬁne-grained sharing of encrypted data that we call Key-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption ({KP}-{ABE}). In our cryptosystem, ciphertexts are labeled with sets of attributes and private keys are associated with access structures that control which ciphertexts a user is able to decrypt. We demonstrate the applicability of our construction to sharing of audit-log information and broadcast encryption. Our construction supports delegation of private keys which subsumes Hierarchical Identity-Based Encryption ({HIBE}).},

	abstract = {In several distributed systems a user should only be able to access data if a user posses a certain set of credentials or attributes. Currently, the only method for enforcing such policies is to employ a trusted server to store the data and mediate access control. However, if any server storing the data is compromised, then the conﬁdentiality of the data will be compromised. In this paper we present a system for realizing complex access control on encrypted data that we call Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption. By using our techniques encrypted data can be kept conﬁdential even if the storage server is untrusted; moreover, our methods are secure against collusion attacks. Previous {AttributeBased} Encryption systems used attributes to describe the encrypted data and built policies into user’s keys; while in our system attributes are used to describe a user’s credentials, and a party encrypting data determines a policy for who can decrypt. Thus, our methods are conceptually closer to traditional access control methods such as Role-Based Access Control ({RBAC}). In addition, we provide an implementation of our system and give performance measurements.},

	abstract = {Several pairing-based cryptographic protocols are recently proposed with a wide variety of new novel applications including the ones in emerging technologies like cloud computing, internet of things ({IoT}), e-health systems and wearable technologies. There have been however a wide range of incorrect use of these primitives. The paper of Galbraith, Paterson, and Smart (2006) pointed out most of the issues related to the incorrect use of pairing-based cryptography. However, we noticed that some recently proposed applications still do not use these primitives correctly. This leads to unrealizable, insecure or too ineﬃcient designs of pairing-based protocols. We observed that one reason is not being aware of the recent advancements on solving the discrete logarithm problems in some groups. The main purpose of this article is to give an understandable, informative, and the most up-to-date criteria for the correct use of pairing-based cryptography. We thereby deliberately avoid most of the technical details and rather give special emphasis on the importance of the correct use of bilinear maps by realizing secure cryptographic protocols. We list a collection of some recent papers having wrong security assumptions or realizability/eﬃciency issues. Finally, we give a compact and an up-to-date recipe of the correct use of pairings.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things ({IoT}) is an emerging network paradigm, which realizes the interconnections among the ubiquitous things and is the foundation of smart society. Since {IoT} are always related to user’s daily life or work, the privacy and security are of great importance. The pervasive, complex and heterogeneous properties of {IoT} make its security issues very challenging. In addition, the large number of resources-constraint nodes makes a rigid lightweight requirement for {IoT} security mechanisms. Presently, the attribute-based encryption ({ABE}) is a popular solution to achieve secure data transmission, storage and sharing in the distributed environment such as {IoT}. However, the existing {ABE} schemes are based on expensive bilinear pairing, which make them not suitable for the resources-constraint {IoT} applications. In this paper, a lightweight no-pairing {ABE} scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography ({ECC}) is proposed to address the security and privacy issues in {IoT}. The security of the proposed scheme is based on the {ECDDH} assumption instead of bilinear Diffie–Hellman assumption, and is proved in the attribute based selective-set model. By uniformly determining the criteria and defining the metrics for measuring the communication overhead and computational overhead, the comparison analyses with the existing {ABE} schemes are made in detail. The results show that the proposed scheme has improved execution efficiency and low communication costs. In addition, the limitations and the improving directions of it are also discussed in detail.},

A Fuzzy {IBE} scheme can be applied to enable encryption using biometric inputs as identities; the error-tolerance property of a Fuzzy {IBE} scheme is precisely what allows for the use of biometric identities, which inherently will have some noise each time they are sampled. Additionally, we show that Fuzzy-{IBE} can be used for a type of application that we term “attribute-based encryption”.},

At the same time curve based cryptography has matured to the extent that eﬃcient curves and algorithms are now well known. However the dynamics of academic research are such that execution speed, mandating continued use of assembly language, trumps all other considerations.

	abstract = {The research on pairing-based cryptography brought forth a wide range of protocols interesting for future embedded applications. One significant obstacle for the widespread deployment of pairing-based cryptography are its tremendous hardware and software requirements. In this paper we present three side-channel protected hardware/software designs for pairing-based cryptography yet small and practically fast: our plain {ARM} Cortex-M0+-based design computes a pairing in less than one second. The utilization of a multiply-accumulate instruction-set extension or a light-weight drop-in hardware accelerator that is placed between {CPU} and data memory improves runtime up to six times. With a 10.1 {kGE} large drop-in module and a 49 {kGE} large platform, our design is one of the smallest pairing designs available. Its very practical runtime of 162 ms for one pairing on a 254-bit {BN} curve and its reusability for other elliptic-curve based crypto systems offer a great solution for every microprocessor-based embedded application.},
